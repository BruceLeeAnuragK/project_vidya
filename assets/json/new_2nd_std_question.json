It is so because after having a discussion with Rohan, she will get to know why Rohan wants to have the book. It might be the case that Rohan would have needed the book urgently.\n",

Ruby found a carrot from the forest and asked Reeyas if he also wanted to have the carrot. Suddenly, a tiger came from behind the tree and started howling loudly. All the three rabbits got terribly frightened and ran towards the pond. \nThey saw their best friend Gumpu, the elephant coming from the pond. Seeing the tiger chasing the rabbits, Gumpu asked them to cross the pond on his nose. The three rabbits quickly jumped on Gumpu’s nose and crossed the pond. The tiger got very angry looking at this. \nGumpu then stored a lot of water in its mouth and raised its trunk to throw the water on the tiger’s face. The water got splashed on the tiger’s face. Gumpu and rabbits laughed loudly looking at the tiger’s terrible condition.\n",

I went inside the cottage and saw nobody there. I was very surprised and also scared to see that there was no one in the house. I went into the kitchen and saw three bowls of porridge. I was very hungry, so I tasted from all the bowls but I liked the porridge only from the tiny bowl as it was just fine for me to eat. I was feeling very tired, so I thought about taking a rest for a while. I found three beds in the bedroom. I tried to fit in all the three beds but it was only the tiny bed where I felt comfortable. I took a nap and then after half an hour, I saw three bears in front of me. They all were staring at me. I got goosebumps looking at them. I thought of nothing thereafter and just ran off from the place. It was a very adventurous experience for me. I enjoyed it and would love to visit the place again.\n",

But there was one problem, the tortoise did not know how to fly while the ducks did. The tortoise came up with an idea. He said that he will hold the stick from the middle with his teeth while the two ducks hold the stick from both the ends. In this way, they all can fly together and reach the lake. But the tortoise was very talkative. He opened his mouth to speak in the middle of the flight. As a result, he fell on the ground and died and the two ducks reached the lake safely.\n\n",
