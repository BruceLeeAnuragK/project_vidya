Ruby found a carrot from the forest and asked Reeyas if he also wanted to have the carrot. Suddenly, a tiger came from behind the tree and started howling loudly. All the three rabbits got terribly frightened and ran towards the pond. \nThey saw their best friend Gumpu, the elephant coming from the pond. Seeing the tiger chasing the rabbits, Gumpu asked them to cross the pond on his nose. The three rabbits quickly jumped on Gumpu’s nose and crossed the pond. The tiger got very angry looking at this. \nGumpu then stored a lot of water in its mouth and raised its trunk to throw the water on the tiger’s face. The water got splashed on the tiger’s face. Gumpu and rabbits laughed loudly looking at the tiger’s terrible condition.\n",

Students are expected to write the answer using their own creative and imaginative skills. \nI have curly locks. I have curly hair. One day I decided to roam around the forest near my cottage. After a few steps, I saw a beautiful and small cottage. I was very happy to see that. I went inside the cottage and saw nobody there. I was very surprised and also scared to see that there was no one in the house. I went into the kitchen and saw three bowls of porridge. I was very hungry, so I tasted from all the bowls but I liked the porridge only from the tiny bowl as it was just fine for me to eat. I was feeling very tired, so I thought about taking a rest for a while. I found three beds in the bedroom. I tried to fit in all the three beds but it was only the tiny bed where I felt comfortable. I took a nap and then after half an hour, I saw three bears in front of me. They all were staring at me. I got goosebumps looking at them. I thought of nothing thereafter and just ran off from the place. It was a very adventurous experience for me. I enjoyed it and would love to visit the place again.\n",
